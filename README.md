Hey there! I'm a data enthusiast with a knack for R programming. ðŸš€ Whether it's crunching numbers or diving into the world of bioinformatics, Iâ€™m all about turning data into insights. I've tackled courses like the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification and R Programming on Coursera, and I'm always eager to learn more and teach what I know. ðŸŽ“ From exploring R packages to making sense of big data, I love using code to solve problems and discover patterns. If youâ€™re into data science, programming, or genomics (or just want to chat about R), hit me upâ€”Iâ€™m always up for nerdy discussions! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ“Š
